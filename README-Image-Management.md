## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### File Formats

- **PNG**: Best for logos and images with transparency
- **WebP**: Modern format with good compression (supported by most browsers)

### Performance
- **Optimize images** before uploading (compress to reasonable file sizes)
- **Use appropriate dimensions** - don't upload 4K images for small displays
- **Consider lazy loading** for better page performance

3. Check browser console for 404 errors
4. Ensure image file is not corrupted

### Background Images Not Changing
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check if CSS has hardcoded background images
3. Verify JavaScript is loading correctly

### File Upload Issues
1. Check file size (should be under 10MB for web use)
2. Verify file format is supported
3. Ensure you have write permissions to the images folder
